# Configuration application matrix

Every setting below is exposed by the shared typed catalog used by the TUI, slash commands, and plain CLI. All rows use the serialized `app.Service.ApplySettings` path: validate, atomically save private YAML, reload that canonical file into the shared process snapshot before returning, and notify runtime owners. Subsequent operations read the refreshed snapshot; minimal direct hooks refresh cached orchestrator controls. Active channels and in-flight work are preserved while their supervisors consume the new snapshot. The three extension rows are the sole restart exception.

| Setting | Prior behavior | Runtime owner and final effect | Validation / application | Verification boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `harness.name` | Live, idle-only | Harness supervisor replaces the adapter before commit | Old harness restored if persistence fails | harness supervisor and service tests |
| `harness.model` | Live, active-safe | Persistence commit and provider-dispatch snapshot share one supervisor fence; admitted turns keep their model and later dispatches use the new value | No runtime model publication if persistence fails | active-turn, continuation, and dispatch-race tests |
| `harness.reasoning_effort` | Live, active-safe | Shares the atomic inference-selection commit and dispatch snapshot with model/service mode | Unsupported model combinations reject; a model change clears stale effort to inherit | capability, adapter, continuation, and dispatch-race tests |
| `harness.service_mode` | Live, active-safe | Shares the atomic inference-selection commit; Codex maps the catalog value to app-server `serviceTier` | Unsupported harness/model combinations reject; a model change clears stale mode to inherit | capability, adapter, continuation, and dispatch-race tests |
| `harness.sandbox` | Live, idle-only | Harness supervisor applies provider policy before commit | Old harness restored if persistence fails | harness policy tests |
| `harness.reviews` | Live | Application and orchestrator read the accepted policy for the next decision | Validation/persistence is all-or-nothing | review-policy tests |
| `harness.chat_agent_prefix` | Live | Application snapshots it immediately before chat dispatch | Validation/persistence is all-or-nothing | prompt-prefix tests |
| `harness.developer_agent_prefix` | Live | Orchestrator snapshots it immediately before implementation/planning dispatch | Validation/persistence is all-or-nothing | orchestration prompt tests |
| `harness.reviewer_agent_prefix` | Live | Orchestrator snapshots it immediately before review dispatch | Validation/persistence is all-or-nothing | orchestration prompt tests |
| `harness.heartbeat_agent_prefix` | Live | Heartbeat snapshots it immediately before audit dispatch | Validation/persistence is all-or-nothing | heartbeat prompt tests |
| `harness.acp_command` | Live, idle-only | Harness supervisor replaces custom ACP before commit | Old harness restored if persistence fails | ACP configuration tests |
| `harness.acp_args` | Live, idle-only | Harness supervisor replaces custom ACP arguments before commit | Old harness restored if persistence fails | ACP argument tests |
| `workspace.history_max_messages` | Live | Prompt construction reads the newest bounded-history count | Validation/persistence is all-or-nothing | history prompt-limit tests |
| `workspace.history_char_limit` | Live | Prompt construction reads the newest character limit | Validation/persistence is all-or-nothing | history prompt-limit tests |
| `workspace.attachment_max_mb` | Live | Channel generation fingerprint and outbound parsing use the accepted limit | Invalid values reject before commit; stale adapters are revoked | channel/media limit tests |
| `workspace.cleanup_retention_days` | Live | Elected primary's eight-hour automatic cleanup reads the newest positive retention for history, validated job archives, terminal-task archiving, and retained isolated workspaces | Whole-day range 1–36500 rejects before commit; strict older-than applies to history/jobs/tasks, while retained isolated workspaces become eligible at the positive-duration boundary | live-retention, app workspace-retention, and strict-cutoff tests |
| `startup.enabled` | Live | Immediate enable/disable actions and text commands register/remove and validate after snapshot reload, including unchanged retries | Invalid values reject before save; native errors identify unverified registration despite a saved preference | startup native-query/environment tests and application/TUI action tests |
| `channels.tui.title` | Live | Shared-state title publication updates attached TUIs | Persistence failure publishes nothing | service title tests |
| `channels.tui.theme` | Live | Palette validates before commit, then publishes to attached TUIs | Unknown/invalid palette rejects before commit | theme service and visual tests |
| `orchestrator.enabled` | Live | Manager fences scheduler state and requests an immediate scan when enabled | Infallible generation publication follows durable commit | heartbeat scheduler tests |
| `orchestrator.interval_seconds` | Restart-bound | Manager now resets its route timer from acceptance; scans remain serialized | Infallible generation publication follows durable commit | live interval wake test |
| `orchestrator.semantic_heartbeat_minutes` | Live | Manager fences the old heartbeat term and schedules from acceptance | Infallible generation publication follows durable commit | heartbeat reschedule/race tests |
| `orchestrator.retrigger_unresponded_messages` | Live | Primary recovery scheduler reads the committed snapshot before every startup/reconnect/periodic scan; enabling requests a coalesced pass | Disabling prevents later scans and does not cancel an admitted communication turn | forward-activation, disable, active-work, and ownership-fence tests |
| `orchestrator.task_notifications` | Live | Every covered transition directly dispatches one ordinary agent; `off`, `decide`, and `always` supply policy context for that agent's own decision | No notification-specific persistence or recovery; the agent edits task progress itself | mandatory outcome/wait matrix, direct-dispatch, prompt-boundary, and no-output-parsing tests |
| `orchestrator.workspace_isolation` | Live for new claims | Orchestrator applies the mode when claiming queued task work; running lineages keep their recorded mode | `shared` or `git-worktree`; isolated claims additionally require the git-worktree preflight and fail closed without a shared fallback | isolation-mode, preflight, and lineage tests |
| `orchestrator.checks` | YAML-only; live for new isolated launches | Orchestrator freezes the captured set per launch and stores its digest in launch evidence; running launches keep their captured set | At most sixteen unique checks with `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{0,63}` ids, a nonempty command, and 1s–2h timeouts (10m default); not a command setting | config validation and check-evidence tests |
| `orchestrator.max_parallel` | Restart-bound | Resizable gate raises promptly; lowering preserves active jobs and blocks new claims until below bound | Infallible generation publication follows durable commit | live capacity test and race suite |
| `extensions.enabled` | Restart-bound | Process-start hook runner snapshot; takes effect after restart | Typed validation and atomic persistence only | catalog restart-bound test |
| `extensions.directory` | Restart-bound | Process-start trusted extension root; takes effect after restart | Typed validation and atomic persistence only | extension discovery tests |
| `extensions.hook_timeout` | Restart-bound | Process-start per-hook timeout; takes effect after restart | Duration validation and atomic persistence only | extension timeout tests |

`channels.tui.enabled` is intentionally absent. Legacy YAML containing it is normalized during load and a canonical save removes it. Bare `spynel` launches the TUI; `spynel serve` remains headless unless invoked with `--tui`.

Task and goal workflows use fixed `.spynel` folders and rules. Unused configuration keys are ignored on load and omitted by the next canonical save.
