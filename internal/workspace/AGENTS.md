# Workspace Initialization DOX

## Purpose

- Own initialized `.spynel` structure, embedded workflow defaults, repair of missing current assets, and user-overridable workspace templates.

## Local Contracts

- Create canonical private directories and configuration without following unsafe state or instruction symlinks; preserve user-edited prompts, themes, instructions, and contracts during upgrades.
- Embed current workflow templates from `templates/` as source of truth for new workspaces. General compatibility migrations and retired asset fixtures do not belong in this package. Upgrade preserves configuration byte-for-byte; unused keys are ignored on load and disappear only on the next canonical save.
- Keep the stock chat template's readable evidence-grounded honesty contract aligned with the framework-owned runtime injection; initialization must materialize it for every new workspace while upgrades preserve user-edited prompt files.
- Delegate built-in palette assets to `internal/theme`; workspace initialization only asks that package to materialize editable copies.
- Automatically managed speech models live in the operating-system user cache, not the workspace.
- Create `.spynel/tasks/archive` as cold history without adding it to live workflows or ordinary workflow status sets.
- Create `.spynel/jobs` as private inspection-only job history; it is not a workflow route or authority source.
- Create `.spynel/runtime/facts`, `.spynel/runtime/launches`, `.spynel/runtime/locks`, and `.spynel/worktrees` as the durable evidence, launch-capture, lock, and isolated-execution directories owned by their runtime packages; they carry no workflow-route meaning.
